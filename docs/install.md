Trader is a boilerplate package to provide your project with basic ecommerce business logic. It is an opinionated package
with a fixed way of handling catalog and order flows. However extensibility for each project is kept in mind by providing a generalistic logic, proper interfaces and events to listen to.

## Install
The Trader package requires Chief as the admin management package.
Install the package in your Laravel app via composer:
```bash
    composer require thinktomorrow/trader
```
The TraderServiceProvider is autodiscovered by Laravel so you don't need to add it to your list of providers.
