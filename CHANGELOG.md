#### Vat rates removed from config

Vat rates are no longer kept in config but rather managed via admin. Only thing to determine in config is the primary
vat country.

- Removed from config: `getDefaultTaxRate()` and `getAvailableTaxRates()` methods. Use `getPrimaryVatRate()` and
  `getPrimaryVatCountry()` instead.
- Removed from laravel config file: `'default_tax_rate' => '21',` and `'tax_rates' => ['21', '6', '12']`.
- Added to laravel config file: `'primary_vat_country' => 'BE'`.

Tax is a more generic term and can be used for other types of taxes as well. The vat term is more specific to the vat of
the catalog prices. Therefore, the term `vat` is used in the codebase instead of `tax`. Tax is used in the context of
the checkout and order.

- Renamed Vat methods to better reflect its behavior. `getTaxRate` is now `getVatPercentage`, `getTaxableTotal` is now
  `getVatApplicableTotal`, `getTaxTotal` is now `getVatTotal` and `getPreciseTaxTotal` is now `getPreciseVatTotal`.

- Added two config values to the trader config file: `fallback_standard_vat_rate` and `primary_vat_country`.

  the following migrations:

});

Schema::table('trader_payment_methods', function (Blueprint $table) {

    $table->string('provider_id');
